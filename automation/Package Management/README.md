# Package Management Bash Script
This bash script provides a simple way to perform 
common package management tasks such as` installing`,` upgrading,` `removing`,
and resolving dependencies for software packages. The script uses the `apt-get` package manager,
which is commonly used in Debian-based systems such as `Ubuntu`.

## Usage
To use the script, simply copy and  paste it into a file with a` .sh `extension, make the file executable by running` chmod +x filename.sh`, and then run the script using` ./filename.sh.`

The script includes four functions:

- `install_package`: installs the specified package
- `upgrade_package`: upgrades the specified package
- `remove_package`: removes the specified package
- `resolve_dependencies`: resolves dependencies for the specified package

Each function takes a single argument, which is the name of the package you want to manage. The functions are called in the script to perform a complete cycle of package management tasks (install, upgrade, remove, and resolve dependencies).

# Note
The script is provided as a starting point and can be modified to meet your specific needs. If you're using a different package manager, you'll need to adjust the commands accordingly.
